\section{Introduction} % (fold)
\label{sec:introduction}
Currently, as a society, we are generating very large amounts of data from a large range of different sources. The rate
of data that is being generated is increasing exponentially, at a rate faster than advancements in storage technology can keep up
with. What this means, in a practical sense, is that it is infeasible for us to attempt to store all of this data. Instead, a hot
topic, in academia and industry associated with big data, is the realtime processing and analysis of streams of data.

While there are currently numerous realtime data processing projects that are in development and production use, both in industry
and academia, often these projects focus on a particular type of data, or facilitate a particular style of processing.
Furthermore, there is no existing complete solution that takes data all the way from the source (regardless of the kind of source), to the storage system.

What we propose in this document is an entire pipeline that will facilitate the following tasks, in sequence:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Take in data streams from generic sources.
  \item Aggregate similar types of data.
  \item Process the data appropriately, depending on its type.
  \item Store the results of the data processing on an appropriate storage medium.
\end{enumerate}

In this document, we will propose the research project which aims to deliver this pipeline. Discussion of the
existing research and work done into this area will be touched on in~\sectref{sec:research_context}. Our research questions,
along with an outline of what we will be doing will be outlined in~\sectref{sec:objectives}. The methodology used to
achieve the deliverables of this project will be discussed in~\sectref{sec:methodology}. Finally, we will conclude with
an overview, in~\sectref{sec:expected_outcomes}, of what the expected outcomes of this project will be, along with the greater contributions this project will give
back, in the way of technological, disciplinary, and societal contributions.
