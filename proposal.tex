\section{Introduction} % (fold)
\label{sec:introduction}

Currently, as a society, we are generating very large amounts of data from a large range of different sources. These
sources include scientific experiments, such as the Australian Synchrotron~\cite{web:synchrotron} and The Large Hadron
Collider~\cite{web:LHC}, companies, such as Amazon~\cite{web:Amazon}, and also data generated by end users of products,
such as social networks. The rate of data that is being generated is constantly increasing, presenting major challenges
when it comes to the storage and processing of that data~\cite{bohlouli_towards_2013}. This is what is often referred to
as ``Big Data''. Out of all of this data we are faced with, often only specific parts of the data are of use for given
purposes. Hence rather than attempting to store all the new data that is being generating, often what is done, in both
academia and industry associated with big data, is the realtime processing and analysis of incoming data streams.

There are currently numerous realtime data processing frameworks that are in development and in production use, both in
industry and academia. Examples of these realtime data processing frameworks include the widely used Storm
project~\cite{web:Storm} developed at BackType and Twitter, Inc., and also the up-and-coming Spark Streaming
project~\cite{web:SparkStreaming} developed at UC Berkeley's AMPLab~\cite{web:UCBerkelyAMCLab}, both of which are
open-source projects. While there are a growing number of these projects being developed, often these projects are
designed with a particular type of data in mind, or to facilitate a particular type of data processing. For example, the
before mentioned Spark Streaming project, along with its mother project, Spark~\cite{web:Spark}, was designed for highly parallelised
data with the use-case in mind of processing data in-memory using highly iterative machine learning algorithms related
to data analytics~\cite{liu_survey_2014}.

Given these, occasionally ``narrow'', use-cases for existing data stream processing frameworks, challenges are faced in
supporting the variations in both data types and processing requirements for data processing applications. In this
research project, we aim to study the different characteristics of the data processing requirements based on the
different characteristics of the data types. The knowledge found of these characteristics will be compared with the
properties of existing solutions for big data processing.

What we propose in this document is an entire heterogeneous data processing pipeline that will facilitate the following
tasks, in sequence:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Take in streams of data from various sources.
  \item Aggregate similar types of data.
  \item Process the data appropriately, depending on its type and the application.
  \item Store the results of the data processing on an appropriate storage medium.
\end{enumerate}

From this research project, we aim to produce a set of recommendations on choosing the various components of the
pipeline, along with recommendations on how the components should be interconnected. To complement this, we also aim to produce a design template on the
deployment of the pipeline in a cloud environment. This will be expanded on in further detail
in~\sectref{sec:expected_outcomes}.

This document will be structured as follows:\\ Discussion of the existing research and work done into this area will be
touched on in~\sectref{sec:research_context}. Our research questions, along with an outline of what we will be doing
will be outlined in~\sectref{sec:objectives}. The methodology used to achieve the deliverables of this project will be
discussed in~\sectref{sec:methodology}. Finally, we will conclude with an overview, in~\sectref{sec:expected_outcomes},
of what the expected outcomes of this project will be, along with the greater contributions this project will give back,
in the way of technological, disciplinary, and societal contributions. % section introduction (end)
